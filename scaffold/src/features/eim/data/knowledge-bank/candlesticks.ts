/**
 * Candlestick Pattern Library — 15 patterns at launch (expands to ~30 in P10).
 *
 * Per master plan §6.G philosophy: patterns are **observations, not
 * predictions**. EIM deliberately defaults to the monthly timeframe inside
 * the simulator; daily and weekly views appear in lesson mode only.
 *
 * SVG conventions for the illustrations below:
 *   - viewBox 0 0 200 100
 *   - green body  -> #22C55E   (close above open)
 *   - red body    -> #EF4444   (close below open)
 *   - neutral     -> #7A7363   (doji / equal open & close)
 *   - wick stroke -> currentColor (inherits from text, theme-aware)
 *
 * Each pattern is drawn at the canonical proportions taught in Nison's
 * Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques (the field's reference text).
