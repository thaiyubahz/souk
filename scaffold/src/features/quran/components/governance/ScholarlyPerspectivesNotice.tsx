/**
 * ScholarlyPerspectivesNotice
 *
 * Implements PDF Section 7 — "allow valid scholarly differences" — and PDF
 * Section 8 — "avoid forcing a particular line, polemical presentation, or
 * sectarian confrontation". Rendered where multiple distinct classical
 * sources appear on the same screen, so the user understands that the
 * platform surfaces multiple perspectives rather than asserting one.
 *
 * Kept presentational and minimal: a single inline note, no toggles, no
 * scholar-comparison UI. Future expansion (multi-position views per madhab)
 * is in Section 11 and out of scope.
